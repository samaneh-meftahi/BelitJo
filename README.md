Notes
The application uses an in-memory H2 database by default, so data resets on each run.

You can configure a persistent database in application.properties if needed.

Error handling is implemented for invalid inputs and insufficient ticket stock.

The code uses Java Streams and Collections for filtering and displaying data.

Future Improvements
Add password authentication for users

Implement a web or GUI interface

Add ticket cancellation and refund features

Support multiple admins with role-based access

Persist data in a production-grade database
